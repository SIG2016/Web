			<td>
				Special Interest Group (SIG) was initiated by Professor Liu, Zhi-Qiang in 2005 and funded by a three-year seed grant from City University of Hong Kong since 2006. SIGs enable in-depth learning and training for BScCM students from Year One of their undergraduate programme. In the SIGs students participate in supervised extracurricular, professional research and development activities, through which students will gain first-hand, practical experience in developing digital media products which will prepare them for successful careers in digital entertainment industry. Special Interest Groups are managed by BScCM student members with the supervision of academic staff associated with the BScCM program. Students sign up for SIGs on their own interests and passions. They initiate and participate in projects that cover games, animation and special visual effects, installation, web-radio, photography, and digital art design. Playful Media is SIG's annual Showcase. The first Playful Media in 2007 was a great success and also co-exhibited with a premier international professional event: Asia's 1st ACM SIGGRAPH Traveling Art Show. Recently, SIGs consist of 5 different groups with special interests in different areas, namely: Animation & Visual Effects, Photography / Graphic Design, Games, Installation & Interaction, and Web Radio.
